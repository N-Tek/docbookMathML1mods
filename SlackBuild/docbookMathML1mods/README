docbookMathML1mods is a group of shell scripts, SGML catalog
and required files used for creating a removable 
SlackBuild package for DocBook MathML modules' DTDs.

After the installation of DocBook MathML modules' DTDs
one of the new catalog files(docbook.new1 OR docbook.new2) 
has to be moved to the /etc/xml/docbook which was installed 
by the 'linuxdoc-tools' package located under 'slackware/ap'.

If 'docbook-xml5' was NOT installed
        docbook.new1 -> /etc/xml/docbook
else
        docbook.new2 -> /etc/xml/docbook

SlackBuild script file will check installation of 'docbook-xml5'
and include the related new catalog file into the 'docbookMathML1mods'
SlackBuild package as docbook.new

If /etc/xml/docbook.new is present it has to be manually moved by the 
user to /etc/xml/docbook for finalizing installation

After the uninstallation of the 'docbookMathML1mods' package
DON'T forget to reinstall 'linuxdoc-tools' package for 
resetting the /etc/xml/docbook to its original state.
